Magisk module to fix Play Integrity in LineageOS for POCO X3 Pro. Google has forced us all to fight with different fingerprints, i might be using my own private build. I won't be able to know that when my latest public build failing device integrity until you can inform me in "Issues" section. I will upstream custom spoof from [Chiteroman](https://github.com/chiteroman/PlayIntegrityFix)'s repo.
