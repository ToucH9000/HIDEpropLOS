Magisk module to fix Play Integrity in LineageOS for POCO X3 Pro. Seems like google isn't giving up, I don't use such apps which require "Device Integrity". If i ever need that, i will be switching to "xiaomi.eu" permanently.

## Bonus Stuff
See [Details](Details.md) for more power.

## Still Confused?
Check out my [Mobile Setup](https://github.com/ToucH9000/Mobile-Specification) to know what's happening. I always update that repo, whenever i find something useful.
