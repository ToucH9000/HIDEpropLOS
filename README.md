# HIDEpropLOS (vayu)
Hide some sensitive properties from detection apps in LineageOS for POCO X3 Pro. For more hiding see [here](https://github.com/ToucH9000/Mobile-Setup/blob/main/Files/build.prop). If you want to test for other device, you need to replace "vayu" with your device codename in "module.prop" and "post-fs-data.sh".

## Bonus Stuff
See [Details](Details.md) for more power.

## Still Confused?
Check out my [Mobile Setup](https://github.com/ToucH9000/Mobile-Specification) to know what's happening. I always update that repo, whenever i find something useful.
